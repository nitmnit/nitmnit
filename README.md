## Who am I?
A Problem Solver who takes ownership and has  the mental resilience to deliver results by going 100 extra miles when required. I have done everything from building and scaling microservices to writing FE during resource crunch to collaborating with carpenters to build office furniture.

## Motivation
I hope to be in a fox-hole with bunch of smart engineers solving real world problems in creative ways to go far beyond expected standards.

## Experience (8 years)
### Associate General Manager (60% Coding  +  30% Team Lead + 10% EM)
#### Arcadis IBI Group, Hyderabad, India | **July 2021 – Now, Oct 2016 - Oct 2018 | Hyderabad, Telangana**
- Achieved scalability of an application from 5 to 500 concurrent users by utilizing various techniques such as Microservice Architecture, Redis Caching, AWS Cloudfront CDN, and optimization of both code (Django) and queries (Django ORM + PSQL).
- Improved API performance by 73% by implementing Cache Aside and Write Around caching strategy, and utilized background processing with Message Brokers (Rabbitmq) for long-running tasks. This resulted in a smoother user experience and increased website traffic.
- Designed and implemented a comprehensive CICD strategy utilizing Kubernetes (with Helm), Bitbucket, AWS, Docker, and GitLab Flow. This enabled us to minimize downtime in production and provided us with the necessary resources to scale rapidly.
- Built data ingestion pipeline (900 Peak QPS) to receive data from 300 IoT Devices using socket.io
- Architected highly scalable notifications service (current capacity 300 QPS, scalable up to 10k Peak QPS) to send Email, SMS, Webapp and Mobile Push Notifications using Django, DRF, and Postgres, ensuring reliable delivery of notifications to users.
- Architected and implemented Hierarchical Geography based access management system. This allows us to limit user's jurisdiction to limited geographical area to manage assets within an Asset Management tool called InForm.
- Wrote complex GIS algorithms to calculate Curb Regulation Attributes from Open Maps database using PostGIS. This is for a Curbside Regulation Management tool called CurbIQ.
- Managed team of 10 developers to empower them, to build a culture of openness, collaboration and led them through Hell Sprint.
- Created an automated CI/CD pipeline (using Bitbucket, AWS, Docker). This allowed us to move to a continuous delivery model, shipping to production once every week (previously, we’d been deploying once in quarter).
- Addressed security vulnerabilities in Product to attain SOC2 certification (Ongoing)
- Standardized and executed the Hiring Process for Engineering and successfully filled 7 open positions.

### Senior Software Engineer (Policies & Data Science Team)
#### Pasarpolis, Gurugram (India) | **Dec 2018 – Sep 2020 | Gurgaon, Haryana**

- Created a Bahasa (Indonesian) chatbot using Google Dialogflow that could perform user authentication, check policy status, raise claims, and upload documents.
- Created highly scalable (500 RPM, Scalable up to 3k RPM) User Microservice for authentication and authorization using Flask and MySQL.
- Took and delivered an initiative to make our Document Generation Service dynamic. Earlier we needed to add HTML templates to repository manually to generate Email Attachments.
- Created an automated tests suite for integration tests across more than 15 microservices to generate policies and claims while raising all the required infrastructure (on GCP) on the fly using Kubernetes and Helm. These tests were part of production deployment pipeline which helped us stabilize the environment.
